title: "Exploring the Geometry and Topology of Neural Network Loss Landscapes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-loss-landscapes
excerpt: 'We present a novel way of sampling the loss landscape of artificial neural networks and use manifold learning and computational homology to study the sampled data. We find that the extracted geometrical and topological features of the loss landscapes hold meaningful information about the model's ability to generalize.'
